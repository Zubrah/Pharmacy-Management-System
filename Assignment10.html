<h2>Attention</h2>
<p>Here are a few things that can make you loose marks, please make sure that you do these things well :)</br>
	If there is no author on the top of every page, that is -5, for every page that does not have an author on the top.</br>
	If your read me does not describe in short what your project does, </br>
	and does not have the names of people in the group, that is -5</br>
	Remember to keep your code, well organized, well commented and clean.</br></p>
