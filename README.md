## A Simple LOGO Fix:
* Change the path of the ImageIcon to the correct path of your machine to allow the program to have a Logo apart from the java logo 
* To do this:

     a) Change from the path in this line in every java class after init component method to correct path in your machine from the Icons folder : 
     
       img = new ImageIcon("C:\\Users\\Zoubar\\Documents\\NetBeansProjects\\Pharmacy_Project\\src\\Icons/icon1.png");
